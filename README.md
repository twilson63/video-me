# Video Me

Video Me is a simple web app that streams your webcam to your browser, it is a simple to use to show yourself in screencasts.

## How to run

``` js
npm install
PORT=3000 npm start
```

## Motivation

This is more of an experiment to see if I can save some time adding a video capture to my screencasts just using the screen-recording of quicktime.  There is propaly an easier way to do this, but it was fun to put together.
